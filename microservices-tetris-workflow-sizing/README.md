# Fitting microservices into workflows like Tetris

## Abstract

In a microservice reality, components are small and focused but don’t provide much value in isolation. In these systems, workflows are where the magic happens: they string together multiple services to participate in a larger conversation that fulfills critical business processes. But how we view and scope these workflows matters. How do you define the scope of a single workflow? How does the workflow size relate to service boundaries? How does the scope affect decisions about coordination mechanisms? And how do you keep a larger overview when you decide to split things apart for the sake of loose coupling? 

Appropriately sizing workflows requires a deep understanding of the context, realizing you have different contexts to consider. There are plenty of aspects that will significantly impact the design of your workflows: from scope, complexity, coordination, visibility, to governance. In this session, we’ll take a varied look at workflows, zooming in, zooming back out, and repeating the process –all over again. You’ll walk away with a diverse set of lenses to focus differently on workflows depending on the problem you’re trying to address, enabling you to choose appropriate designs that achieve your goals.
