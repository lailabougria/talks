Here you can find a list of resources to further your understanding of these topics. I try to keep this list up to date with new resources I come across, if you can think of valuable additions, feel free to contribute!


### Books

- [Distributed tracing in practice, by Austin Parker, Daniel Spoonhower, Jonathan Mace, Ben Sigelman, Rebecca Isaacs](https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Tracing-Practice-Instrumenting-Microservices/dp/1492056634)

This book is a thorough guide into distributed tracing, but also covers metrics and logging, although the main focus is on tracing. This book is not specifically focussed on OpenTelemetry, but rather discusses a wider range of possibilities. Considering the backgrounds of these authors, you can't get better insights than these!
