# Resources

Here you can find a list of resources to further your understanding of these topics. I try to keep this list up to date with new resources I come across, if you can think of valuable additions, feel free to contribute!

## Techniques

- [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/)

### Books

- [Start with WHY](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/): This book takes a deep-dive into WHY, and how it affects what we do, how we do it, and how that translates to our customers.
- [HBR Guide to Thinking Strategically](https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-guide-to-thinking-strategically/10237): This book contains a collection of articles on how to improve your strategic thinking. Most of the techniques discussed in this book strongly align with the techniques I discuss in the session surrounding decision-making.
