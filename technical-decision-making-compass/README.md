# Find true north with a technical decision-making compass

## Abstract

Do you ever feel like you're swimming in a sea of technological possibilities without a compass to guide you? Perhaps you've built a system with all the latest and greatest technologies, only to find it's more complicated than a tesseract? Or maybe you've stepped into a running project that was so unnecessarily complex, you wondered how they ever got there. I've been there, more than once... As tech professionals, we face an abundance of options to solve a particular problem which can lead to biased decision-making, where we choose solutions based on other's success stories neglecting their context and our own eagerness to learn.

Over the last years of my career, I have applied a set of practices to decision-making that have steered me in the right direction by focussing on what matters. This didn't only affect my own decision-making, but also how I evaluate and challenge decisions made by others. In this session, I'll share my experiences and insights on the essential building blocks that improve critical thinking, help break through biases, and improve our intent and communication when making impactful decisions. You'll learn to ask the right questions and apply tactics to help identify assumptions, evaluate options objectively, and assess risk. You'll walk out of this session with a reliable compass to navigate our complex and ever-changing technical landscape confidently.
