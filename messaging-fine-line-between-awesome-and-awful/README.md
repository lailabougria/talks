# Messaging: The fine line between awesome and awful (and how to stay on the right side of it)

![fine line](messaging-fine-line-banner.jpg)

## Abstract

Distributed systems are becoming increasingly common in today's systems landscape, and messaging is often used to coordinate between components in these systems safely. With benefits like increased reliability, better performance, easy scalability, and easier decoupling of components, you might quickly think, "Shut up and take my money!". However, as with any architectural choice, the other side of the coin surfaces challenges and pitfalls that we must consider: structuring code to fully leverage messaging, dealing with duplicate messages and ordering issues, and diagnosing problems.

To address these problems, we need to understand the messaging communication patterns available and when to use them, how to effectively decouple code and consider techniques for ensuring consistency in the system. Finally, we must prepare for and mitigate any unknowns that may arise that we can't anticipate. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the problem space that comes with messaging and will be better equipped to make informed decisions about whether and how to incorporate messaging into your distributed systems.
