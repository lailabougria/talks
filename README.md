# Public speaking engagements

Hi there! If you're visiting, that means you might have watched [one of my talks](https://sessionize.com/noctovis/), either in real life or online.

Here, you'll find my slides, any code samples or demo's around the subject, as well as any additional resources that might be of interest if you'd like to expand your knowledge on the topic.

## How to navigate this repo

Each talk's resources is stored by name in a dedicated folder, each containing its own README file with additional information. 

## Share the love <3
