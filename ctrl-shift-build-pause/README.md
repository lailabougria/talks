# CTRL+SHIFT+~~BUILD~~ PAUSE

![CTRL+SHIFT+BUILD-PAUSE](ctrl-shift-build-pause-banner.png)

## Abstract

Copilots are everywhere these days, and… rightfully so! Let's face it: these tools are incredible at getting things done. They have the potential to turn any one of us into a 20x developer. Need a new feature? Bam, there you have it! Refactor that function? Sure, it'll be done before you grind the coffee for your next cup. These tools do a very good job of generating well-designed, tested, and performant code. Before you know it, you're not just building a feature—you're building 17 slightly different features simultaneously because why not? After all, the code writes itself!

But guess what? Just because you _can_ build it doesn't mean you _should_. Without a clear vision, our solutions risk becoming soulless Franken-software, a mishmash of best intentions and uncontrolled enthusiasm that don't make the user's life any easier. That’s why we need to remind ourselves that the true art of building great systems is more about what you choose **not** to do. More than ever, our mission needs to remain crystal clear: crafting lasting, impactful solutions that our users love.

## Is there a recording?
