### Overview of the five-question framework

During this session, I introduced a framework of five essential questions we should be asking when evaluating the best-suited coordination style.

This is [documented in more detail](5-questions.md), accompanied with a flowchart.

### Books

The following books cover the topics orchestration and choreography. They're listed in order of relevance:

### Observability

Independent of the coordination style you end up with, implementing an observability strategy will be crucial to operating your systems in production.
