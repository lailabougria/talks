# Orchestration vs. Choreography: The good, the bad, and the trade-offs

## Abstract

Our goal when building microservices is reducing the complexity of individual components. In doing so, some of that complexity shifts from inside an individual service to the inter-service communication. In your research on the topic, you may have bumped into the terms orchestration and choreography. While the web offers a vast range of articles that carefully outline the pros and cons of each pattern, the real challenge is left to the reader: deciphering which pattern best fits your specific use case by understanding which arguments don’t apply to your use case and weighing only the relevant ones in your decision.

In this session, we’ll dive more deeply into each pattern, taking a thorough look at what problem each is aiming to address. This will help us build a mental framework to make well-balanced decisions when to use each pattern, including when to switch from one pattern to the other. Join me in this session, where we’ll transform the abstract concepts of orchestration and choreography into a tangible decision-making framework that steers you in the right direction.
