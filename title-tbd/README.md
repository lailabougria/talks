## Abstract

Distributed systems are becoming increasingly common in today's systems landscape, and messaging is often used to safely coordinate between components in these systems. The benefits of using messaging are numerous, including increased reliability, better performance, easy scalability, and simpler decoupling of components, at which point you might think "Shut up and take my money!". However, as with any architectural choice, the other side of the coin surfaces challenges and pitfalls that must be considered: diagnosing problems, understanding the state of the system, handling duplicate messages or idempotency.

To address these problems, we will discuss best practices for designing and implementing durable messaging, including techniques for ensuring reliability, consistency, decoupling and dealing with all the unknown unknowns of distributed systems. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the problem space that comes along with messaging, and will be better equipped to make informed decisions about whether and how to incorporate messaging into your distributed systems.
