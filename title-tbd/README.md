## Abstract

Distributed systems are becoming increasingly common in today's systems landscape, and messaging is often used to safely facilitate communication and coordination between components in these systems. The benefits of using messaging are numerous, including increased reliability, better performance, easy scalability, and simpler decoupling of components. However, as with any architectural choice, there are also challenges and pitfalls that must be considered:

- What do you mean I can't have transactions?
- What happens when something unexpected occurs?
- At least once delivery increases consistency and resilience, but how do I deal with duplicates?
- What's the current status of a business process in a decoupled, distributed system?
- How do I diagnose problems in a distributed system?

To address these challenges, we will discuss best practices for designing and implementing messaging in a distributed system, including techniques for ensuring reliability, consistency, and decoupling. We will also consider the unknown unknowns of distributed systems, and how to prepare for and mitigate potential issues that may arise. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and pitfalls of using messaging in distributed systems, and will be equipped to make informed decisions about whether and how to incorporate messaging into your systems.
